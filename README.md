## Description of the problem to be solved

The objective of this assignment involves building a question and answer system. Similar to a chatbot, this system will take a question as an input and provide back a one sentence answer. The questions have to be either who/what/where/when questions. In that way, the answer returned will simply respond to the specific detail requested in the question. The system developed utlizes a wikipedia package from python that facilitates with searching an answer to the factual question. This system incorporates chatbot style system entailing re expressions and token extraction, along with named entity recognition for deciphering the content of the question and finally text summarization in order to give back a user friendly response.
